# 💸 Sampada - Full-Stack Expense Tracker

**Sampada** (Sanskrit for *Wealth* and *Prosperity*) is a high-performance personal finance orchestrator. It transforms raw transaction data into actionable financial clarity through a reactive, state-optimized frontend and a secure, hardened Spring Boot backend.

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

The application follows a decoupled client-server architecture. The frontend focuses on optimistic UI updates and efficient caching, while the backend ensures ACID-compliant transactions and stateless security.

* **Presentation Layer:** React 18 (Vite) with **Shadcn UI**.
* **State Management:** Hybrid approach using **Zustand** (UI-state) and **React Query** (server-state caching).
* **API Layer:** RESTful Spring Boot services with specialized endpoints for high-volume data aggregation.
* **Security Layer:** JWT-based stateless authentication with password hashing and protected resource filters.
